## Quick Start 
Follow INSTALL.md to install all the requirements

Bringup nodes:
```
    ros2 launch stinger_bringup sensors.launch.py
        If wish to run independently:
        - ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 sllidar_c1_launch.py
        - ros2 run stinger_bringup camera-node
    ros2 launch stinger_bringup ekf.launch.py
    ros2 launch stinger_bringup tf.launch.py
    ros2 run stinger_bringup motor-node
        - ros2 topic pub /stinger/thruster_port/cmd_thrust std_msgs/msg/Float64 "{data: 20.0}"
```
Autonomy nodes:
```
    ros2 run stinger_autonomy detection-node
    ros2 run stinger_autonomy controller-node
```

## Simulation Quick start
```
ros2 launch stinger_bringup vehicle_sim.launch.py
```
